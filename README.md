# MasterMind
A mastermind game

As an introduction to Python and OOP programming, this mastermind game has been made.
During the creation of this project I learned about:
- OOP (composition, inheritance, delegation, encapsulation)
- Python (imports, init, list comprehension, Python specific OOP)
- UML (use-case and class diagram)
- Unit tests

As it was all learned during the project, for most of these topics, only a start of an implementation has been made. The project will (for now) not be refactored but be a project to include as many of these techniques as possible as a first introduction.

This means, a lot of the things in this project are unfinished or not implemented. This is fine for the purpose of the project.

## Tools
- For creation of the UML diagrams, PlantUML has been used.
